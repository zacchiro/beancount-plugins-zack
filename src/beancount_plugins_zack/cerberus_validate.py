"""Beancount plugin that allows to enforce data validation rules on ledgers.

Rules are specified via an external YAML file and interpreted according to
`Cerberus <http://docs.python-cerberus.org/>`_ semantics. The rules file must
be passed to the plugin as a configuration string, e.g.::

    plugin "mybeancount.public.validate" "validate.yaml"


Rules
=====

A rule is conceptually a pair <match, constraint>, where the match defines to
which Beancount elements the rule applies, and constraint(s) to be enforced on
matching elements. Additional, a rule description is required for ease of rule
reference. The rules file is hence a list of rules, expressed in YAML syntax,
like this::

      - description: rule 1's description
        match:
          # rule 1's match goes here
        constraint:
          # rule 1's constraint goes here

      - description: rule 1's description
        match:
          # rule 2's match
        constraint:
          # rule 2's constraint

      - description: rule 1's description
        match:
          # rule 3's match
        constraint:
          # rule 3's constraint

    - # etc.


Constraints
===========

Constraints are applied to matching Beancount elements. An error would be
returned if the selected Beancount element does not satisfy the associated
constraint.

The constraint language is that of `Cerberus
<http://docs.python-cerberus.org/>`_, a popular data-validation framework for
Python. Specifically, a constraint for this validate plugin is a Cerberus
`schema <http://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/schemas.html>`_. Cerberus
schemas being Python dictionaries, you will simply express the desired schema
in YAML syntax. Schemas will be enforced on Beancuont data structures,
transformed to nested Python dictionaries (see "Validation data model" below).

For instance, you can enforce the fact that a Beancount element has a mandatory
"author" metadata field like this::

    constraint:
      meta:
        schema:
          author:
            required: true

See Cerberus `validation rules
<http://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/validation-rules.html>`_ for details
about the full constraint language.


Matches
=======


Target
------

By default rules are applied to Beancount transactions. You can override the
default using the "target" property of match sections; its value can be the
name of a top-level Beancount entry ("transaction", "open", "document", etc.),
"posting" (meaning individual transaction postings), or the special value "all"
(meaning all top-level entries). You can also use a list of those values to
match multiple Beancount elements at once. Examples::

    - match:
        target: transaction  # the default: apply rule to transactions
      ...

    - match:
        target: open  # apply rule to open entries instead
      ...

    - match:
        target:  # apply rule to transaction, open, and document entries
          - document
          - open
          - transaction
      ...

    - match:
        target: all  # apply rule to to all top-level entries
      ...

    - match:
        target: posting  # apply rule to individual transaction postings
      ...


Account
-------

The "account" property of matches allow to restrict rule application to
Beancount elements affecting a given account. Postings will satisfy an account
condition if the given account name is identical to the one of the posting or,
if the "account" value is surrounded by "/", if the posting account name
matches the given regular expression.

As a shorthand, you can use "account" properties to filter transactions. A
transaction will satisfy an "account" property if at least one of its potsings
matches its value.

Examples::

    - description: checking transactions must have a bank-label
      match:
        target: transaction
        account: /^Assets:.*:Checking/
      constraint:
        meta:
          schema:
            bank-label:
              required: true

    - description: cheque postings must have a cheque number
      match:
        target: posting
        account: /:Cheque$/
      constraint:
        meta:
          schema:
            cheque:
              required: true


Schema
------

You can use the "schema" property of matches to define conditional validation
rules of the form "if this Beancount element matches this schema (specified in
the match section), then it must *also* match this other schema (specified in
the constraint section)". For instance::

    - description: transactions made using my card must have me as author
      match:
        target: transaction
        schema:
          meta:
            schema:
              card:
                required: true
                allowed:
                  - "12345678"
      constraint:
        meta:
          schema:
            author:
              required: true
              allowed:
                - Zack


Validation data model
=====================

Constraints are enforced on Beancount elements which conforms with the
definitions found in the :mod:`beancount.core.data` module, after some
"massaging" to ease data validation. In particular, the following
transformations are applied before validation:

* conversion from nested namedtuples to nested dictionaries: the tuple
  structure of beancount.core.data is transformed to nested dictionaries, using
  the _asdict() method of namedtuples recursively. This allow to validate
  Beancount abstract syntax trees (ASTs) using Cerberus schemas (Cerberus
  doesn't allow to validate attributes). For instance, you can pretend 'meta'
  is a key of transaction directives, even if in beancount.core.data it is a
  namedtuple attribute.

* propagation of metadata from transactions down to postings. For instance,
  given the following input transaction::

      1970-01-01 * "grocery"
        author: "zack"
        Expenses:Grocery      10.00 EUR
          foo: "bar"
        Assets:Checking

  what validation rules will actually consider is::

      1970-01-01 * "grocery"
        author: "zack"
        Expenses:Grocery      10.00 EUR
          foo: "bar"
          author: "zack"
        Assets:Checking
          author: "zack"

Note that these transformations are in effect only during validation and are
discarded afterwards. The set of directives returned by this plugin are
unchanged w.r.t. its input.
