"""Beancount plugin that allows to enforce data validation rules on ledgers.

Rules are specified in a simple DSL implemented as Python functions.

Rules must be passed to the plugin via a configuration string that must be a
syntactically valid Python list consisting of validation rules (the string will
be eval()-ed by the plugin, you've been warned), e.g.::

  plugin "mybeancount.public.validate" "[
    ('bank operations must have a bank label',
     (has_account, r('^Assets:.*:Checking')), (has_metadata, 'bank-label')),
    ('receivables must have a debtor',
     (has_account, r('^Assets:(Receivables|Reimbursable)')),
     (has_metadata, 'debtor')),
    ('cheque payments must declare check number',
     (has_account, r(':Cheque$')), (has_metadata, 'cheque')),
    ('incomes must have payee',
     (has_account, r('^Income:')), (has_payee,)),
    ('payables must have a creditor',
     (has_account, r('^Liabilities:Payables')), (has_metadata, 'creditor')),
    ('metadata project must be either debian or spi',
     (has_metadata, 'project'), (metadata_value_in, 'project', ('debian', 'spi'))),
  ]"

Each rule is a triple <description, check, constraint>. Description is a human
readable string that will be shown in case of validation errors. Check is a
predicate on transactions. Constraint will be enforced on transactions iff the
Check predicate matches.

The following functions can be used to assemble checks and constraints:

- has_account
- has_metadata
- has_narration
- has_payee
- has_tag
- metadata_value_eq
- metadata_value_in

See the docstrings of the corresponding functions in this module for more
details about their semantics.

The following functions can be used as helpers:

- r: shortand for re.compile(), case-insensitive by default
- fake_tags: parse posting-specific tags out of a "tags" metadata

Again, see docstring for details.
