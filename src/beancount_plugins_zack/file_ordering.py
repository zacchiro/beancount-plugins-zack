"""This Beancount plugin validates that each Beancount file that contains 2 or
more transactions is strictly chronologically ordered. I.e., no transaction
that occurs later in a given file (in file order) has a date that occurs
earlier (in calendar order) than a previous transaction in the same file.

While Beancount by default doesn't care about file ordering of directives,
ensuring in-file date ordering on transaction is a useful check to avoid
certain kinds of booking errors, e.g., copy-pasting an old transaction,
forgetting to bump its date.

"""

# TODO this plugin can be easily made configurable to, e.g.:
# - enforce reverse date ordering
# - enforce ordering on arbitrary metadata, not only date
